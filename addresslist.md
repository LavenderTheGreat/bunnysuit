# Sonic Battle US Addresses

For bunnysuit, you'll want to use the Pointer Location address.

This currently uses data collected by Glimmer and posted in https://github.com/phase/sbhs/issues/7#issuecomment-402008379 , it ignores most completely unknown entries. There's some extra data which will be added soon tm.
